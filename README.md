# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts house prices based on various input features using supervised machine learning techniques. The goal is to help understand how different factors influence housing prices and build a model that can generalize well to unseen data.

## 📌 Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature selection and visualization
- Model training using algorithms like:
  - Linear Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting
- Model evaluation using metrics like R² Score and RMSE
- Interactive Jupyter Notebook for demonstration
